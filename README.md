# Exam Prep for Tableau Desktop Specialist Certification

## 1. Introduction

I recently passed the Tableau Desktop Specialist Certification examination. The version I was tested on is 2020.1 and by that time Tableau has issued its latest version 2020.2. I want to share here how I prepared for it and I hope this article can be helpful for those who want to get certified as well.


## 2. Registration 

There are three types of certifications for Tableau Desktop, and **Specialist** is the simplest one. Go to the [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/learn/certification/desktop-specialist) page to know more about the exam detail.

Pay attention to which version you will be tested on. I was practicing using the latestest version 2020.2 for which Tableau just launched a new feature called Relationship. However, in my real exam which was tested on 2020.1, this new feature was not yet launched so I was not tested on any of the relationship related questions. 

Download the Exam Prep Guide as it tells you which topic the test will be focusing on. I found the prep guide very useful as I used it as a checklist to see if I fully covered each topic and knowledge point.

You may reschedule the exam if you want to. It is nice that you only need to pay $5 to rechedule the exam. You may also retake the exam if needed. 


## 3. Preparation
In terms of Preparation time, I spent 6 days to systemetically prepare for this test. Even though I learnt and used Tableau before, I still felt that there were so many new things to learn. If you are a new learner with zero knowledge of Tableau Desktop, I recommend you take at least two weeks' time to learn Tableau before taking the exam. If you have previous experience of using Tableau, I recommend you take about 5-7 days simply for refreshing your memory and checking what is missing from your knowledge base. Here I also want to list out some online resources that I found helpful:

* Tableau Essential Training (2020.1) by Curt Frye. You can find this course on LinkedI learning.
* Tutorials Point (India) Ltd. This is a free tutorial on Youtube.
* Learningtableau.com This website offers both online courses and pratice exams.
* Tableau Desktop Specialist Certification - Practice Tests'20 on Udemy. There are four sets of practice exams in this course package.


## 4. Examination

Now let's talk about D-day. Go to the test page and you'll be allowed to set up your online test 1 minute before your actual test time. Hold on - before you sit by your desk to take the test, there're a few things you need to do:

1. Clean up your desk to make sure that there's no learning materials such as book, printed paper or your ipad around your desk. 
2. Unplug your monitor(s) as you're only allowed to use your desktop screen. However, wireless devices such as bluetooth mouse and keyboards are allowed. 
3. Make sure you dress up decently. As you will be monitored throughout the exam, you should dress properly. Pajamas are fine (based on my experience). Suits and ties will not be necessary. 
4. Make sure you get everything you need: water, ear plugs if needed, and most importantly, government issued ID. The ID must NOT expired. You will not be allowed to leave your seat once the test starts.
5. If you follow the instructions carefully, you will notice that you're asked to check your internet connectivity. Even if your result is fine, you may still experience some latency during the actual exam. Be calm and carry on. If your virtual machine freezes completely, let your proctor know immediately. 

## 5. Post examination
1. After your exam, you will know your results immediately. Your results and your electronic badge will be emailed to you shortly after your exam. Some bloggers who took the exam said they received their emails in 5 minutes but for me it was like 35 minutes. It totally depends so don't be panic if yours don't arrive in 5 minutes or so. After all, Tableau said it could take up to 48 hours for you to receive the email.
2. Don't forget to accept your badge and you can also publish it on LinkedIn which is cool!


## 6. Summary 
This summarizes my experience of taking the Tableau Desktop Specialist Examination. I hope you enjoyed reading it. Keep in mind that scheduling for this exam is half success as you already did something most people don't think about doing. Also, enjoy the time preparing for this exam and don't feel bad if you don't pass for the first time. You can also retake the exam and I believe the second time will be much better than the first one! Good luck to y'all!
